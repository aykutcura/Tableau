## What have I learnt throughout my Projects on Tableau?

1- Data Visualization Techniques: Learning visualization techniques such as creating bar charts, line charts, scatter plats, maps and treemaps. Exploring different chart types and undertand how to represent the data effectively.

2- Dashboard Design: Showcasing well designed dashboards, Being able to learn how to arrange and organize visualizations, add interactive filters, create navigation elements, and incorporate user-friendly features into my dashboards.

3- Data Preaparation and Blending: Learning how to prepare the data for analysis, including techniques for data cleaning, reshaping, and blending multiple data sources. I also learned about data joins, data blending, data parsing, and transforming data for better visualization.

4- Calculations and Expressions: Developing an understanding on how to demonstrate and create calculated fields, custom formulas, and expressions using Tableau's calculation language. As well as learning how to perform aggregations, create conditional statements, and define calculated measures to enhance my analysis.

5- Interactivity and Filters: Utilizing interactivity features such as filters, parameters, and actions I learned how to create dynamic visualizations that allow users to interact with the data and explore different aspects of the analysis.

6- Advanced Analytics: Some of the techniques i used over the years were forecasting, trend analysis, clustering, and statistical calculations. Also learning how to leverage Tableau's built-in analytical functions or integrate with external statistical tools.

7- Storytelling and Presentation: Using storytelling elements where data visualizations are combined to tell a cohesive story or present insights. This is where i was able to tell compelling narratives, add annotations, and structures in my analysis for effective communication with stakeholders.
